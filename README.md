# Sketch2Wireframe Code Repository

This is the code repository for Sketch2Wireframe. To get started quickly with our code, please follow the steps below:

1. Click on this link ([your link here]()) to download our pre-trained AMS-RCNN and place it in the `model` folder.
2. Open the plugin menu in Adobe XD, put the `plugin` folder into Adobe XD's developer folder, and reload the folder.
3. Run `main.py`. This file will invoke our AMS-RCNN and HybOptimizer.
4. Open Adobe XD, click the "upload" button in our Sketch2Wireframe plugin, upload the sketch, and then click "ok".
5. At this point, the AMS-RCNN and HybOptimizer will run and produce the optimized digital wireframe layout.
